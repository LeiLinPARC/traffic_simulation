We report a new phase transition in the Intelligent Driver Model. By tuning the exponent of the interaction term, the simulated traffic flow can be rendered stable across a wide range of vehicle densities, accelerations, and decelerations.

\section{Implementation}
For performance reasons, the simulation engine has been implemented as a \textsc{C++} program. It reads the simulation parameters from a text file, runs the simulation, and saves the desired values (e.g. vehicle position \& velocity as a function of time) in another file.

This back-end is controlled by a suite of tools written in \textsc{Python}, which also perform data analysis. The \textsc{Python} front-end feeds parameters to the engine, and processes its output.
